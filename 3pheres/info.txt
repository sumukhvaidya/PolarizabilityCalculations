Simulation for three spheres.
1. Navigate to the directory where you want to run the calculation 
2. Make the deploy.sh file an executable by running 
    chmod u+x deploy.sh
3. Now run the deploy.sh file by running
    ./deploy.sh

The volume is written in the outpolfinal.csv and polarization is written in outpolfinal.csv.
Use Python or Matlab to plot it.
I have provided a simple matlab script to plot but you will need to modify to run it.
