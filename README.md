# PolarizabilityCalculations
Calculate dielectric polarizability of various geometries.

This follows the basic tutorials of opensource tools gmsh and and Scuff-em.

Basic prerequisites:
1. Working version of BASH.
   WSL works, I have written and tested this in WSL.
2. HDF5
3. libGDSII
4. Scuff-em
5. gmesh

I have uploaded a bash script (written by someone else) that lets you download and install most prerequisites for this.
You mostly need to follow instruction on how to run it.
